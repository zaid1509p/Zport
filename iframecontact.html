<p style="text-align:center;">Our leader, Zaid Mohammed, was born on January 15th, 2009 in Columbus, Ohio. Growing up, he loved sports and whenever he would buy sports jerseys with his own money, he would hate at how expensive these jerseys would be. Then, he brought together a group of people who had the same issue and he started our company. Our mission. Our goal. Zports; to sell jerseys and make every sport fan enjoy wearing the same shirt as their favorite sport icon. In his words, he said, "I will make every sport fan in the world happy because they will be able to recieve and jersey they want because of our company's goal."
